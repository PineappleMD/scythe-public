This is a web scraper designed to handle pagination, filters such as age and gender, and has built-in evasion techniques to circumvent detection and automated logging mechanisms.
PLEASE NOTE: This web scraper was designed to pull data from specific STATIC sites, it does not work on sites that load dynamic data with JavaScript, it is NOT a one program scrapes all solution. Retry and retry delay is not fully implemented. Upload script posted which takes scraped data and uploads it to a Supabase database.
Roadmap: Planning to add auto-rotating proxies with random user agents & smart reference pages which adapt to the previous page scraped.
